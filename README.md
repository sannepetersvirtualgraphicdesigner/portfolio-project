## Responsive Web Development Portfolio Project

Have a look at my responsive developer portfolio website with a simple but clean UI. Based on my Sanne Peters Virtual Graphic Designer business style guide.
[You can view it here on Netlify](https://portfolio-project-092021.netlify.app) and [here on my business hosting](https://developer.sannepeters.com).

## How it's made

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries, etc)
- Bootstrap (Navigation, Utility Classes, Navbar, Grid layout, Spacing, etc)

## Special thanks/credits to 
- SheCodes Workshops for teaching me coding
